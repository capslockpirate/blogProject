# blogProject

This is my frontend CRUD interface for a blog

To run locally:
1. clone the project and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8000`in your browser.

A few assumptions I made when creating this

1. ID would be generated by the server.
2. Timestamp would be generated by the server
